# Gossip Glomers

[Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) are a series of distributed systems challenges designed
by fly.io with the help of Kyle Kingsbury, the author of [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io).

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges using the library
[rust-maelstrom-node](https://github.com/sitano/maelstrom-rust-node/). In `archived/` are my
solutions up until challenge 3 from a previous attempt following Jon Gjengset's approach as he
explained [on stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gboGyccRVXI).

I've worked on these exercises during my batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) in
April-June 2023.

## TODO
* [ ] Finish challenge 6c
* [ ] Check that the solutions pass the Broadcast efficiency tests

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [@aphyr](https://github.com/aphyr) and fly.io for the challenges, and to
[@sitano](https://github.com/sitano) for writing the rust library
